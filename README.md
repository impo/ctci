# C++ Solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview
Solutions are uploaded as .cpp files, complete with write-ups commented at the top of each
file.

Write-ups contain the following sections, if applicable:
* Problem - a summary of the problem
* Implementation - an explanation of the solution
* Time complexity - the big-O time complexity of the solution, along with an explanation of why the solution
suffers from that worst-case time complexity.
* Space complexity - the same as above, except for space instead of time.
* What could be done better? - An explanation of any improvements that might be made to the solution.
